NYC AirBnb Listings Price Prediction
Since founded in 2008, Airbnb has become a novel and popular choice for people staying
during their visit to a new place. Therefore, the common rental price of an Airbnb listing is of
interest to both hosts and renters. In this project, we aim to find the best smart price
prediction model for Airbnb listings in NYC, which is one of the most bustling and
prosperous cities in the world. The original data was obtained via Kaggle, and we also 
take crime rate of each precinct and distance to nearest subway station into consideration. 
We started with data exploration, and experimented with various machine learning techniques, 
from linear regression to tree-based methods. Eventually, we found the Random Forest model was 
our top choice with the lowest test error of 0.1268. With the reasonable prediction error, 
we concluded with a discussion on business implications, limitations and future scope.
